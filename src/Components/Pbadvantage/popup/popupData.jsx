        and retirement plans.

      2. General Insurance– Also known as non-life insurance, general insurance
      is defined as any insurance that that doesn’t fall in the category of life
      insurance. As per applicable terms and conditions, it provides pre-decided
      insurance coverage to the insured in exchange of a specific premium.
      <p>
